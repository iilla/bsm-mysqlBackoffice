# Backoffice for SQL and data Management 

## 🌟 Project Overview

<p>
  Basic database consulting tool for mysql databases, with some filter options and data extraction to excel sheet files. Easy to use and configure. This project aims to help to manage a MySQL database      for users who are unfamiliar with those technologies. It outputs simple queries by using a form to select the preferred field and the precision of the search. It is also capable of exporting the output in a simple xml excel sheet. 

  The configuration file can be prepared for data filtering (such as the output of just a selection of tables, if we are willing to hide any data to the end user) and the display of different table output size, with more or less fields.
